                                                        <p>As the global prevalence of childhood obesity continues to rise, researchers and clinicians have sought to develop more effective and personalized intervention techniques. In doing so, obesity interventions have expanded beyond the traditional context of nutrition to address several facets of a child’s life, including their psychological state. While the consideration of psychological features has significantly advanced the view of obesity as a holistic condition, attempts to associate such features with outcomes of treatment have been inconclusive. We posit that such uncertainty may arise from the univariate manner in which features are evaluated, focusing on a particular aspect such as loneliness or insecurity, but failing to account for the impact of co-occurring psychological characteristics. Moreover, co-occurrence of psychological characteristics (both child and parent/guardian) have not been studied from the perspective of their relationship with nutritional intervention outcomes. To that end, this work looks to broaden the prevailing view: laying the foundation for the existence of complex interactions among psychological features. In collaboration with a non-profit nutritional clinic in Brazil, this paper demonstrates and models these interactions and their associations with the outcomes of a nutritional intervention.</p>

								<strong>Background:</strong>
									Known colloquially as the “weekend effect,” the association between weekend admissions and increased mortality within hospital settings has become a highly contested topic over 									the last two decades. Drawing interest from practitioners and researchers alike, a sundry of works have emerged arguing for and against the presence of the effect across various 									patient cohorts. However, it has become evident that simply studying population characteristics is insufficient for understanding how the effect manifests. Rather, to truly 										understand the effect, investigations into its underlying factors must be considered. As such, the work presented in this manuscript serves to address this consideration by moving 									beyond identification of patient cohorts to examining the role of ICU performance.

								<strong>Methods</strong>
									Employing a comprehensive, publicly available database of electronic medical records (EMR), we began by utilizing multiple logistic regression to identify and isolate a specific 									cohort in which the weekend effect was present. Next, we leveraged the highly detailed nature of the EMR to evaluate ICU performance using well-established ICU quality scorecards 									to assess differences in clinical factors among patients admitted to an ICU on the weekend versus weekday.

								<strong>Results</strong>
									Our results demonstrate the weekend effect to be most prevalent among emergency surgery patients (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.19, 1.96), specifically those diagnosed with circulatory 										diseases (P<.001). Differences between weekday and weekend admissions for this cohort included a variety of clinical factors such as ventilatory support and night-time discharges.

								<strong>Conclusions</strong>
									This work reinforces the importance of accounting for differences in clinical factors as well as patient cohorts in studies investigating the weekend effect.

                                                        <p>As the healthcare industry shifts from traditional fee-for-service payment to value-based care models, the need to accurately quantify and compare the performance of institutions has become an integral component of both policy and research. To date, several notable metrics have been introduced, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaids Hospital Value Based Purchasing (HVBP) program. However, despite widespread adoption, these standards suffer from a fundamental oversight. Where the factors utilized to characterize performance reflect only intrinsic facets of an institutions care, capturing elements of mortality rates, patient satisfaction, outcomes, and spending. Yet, this approach is directly at odds with our current understanding of health and wellness, as it is well known that social, economic, and community factors are deeply intertwined with healthcare outcomes. To this end, with institutions spread across diverse geographic regions, our manuscript demonstrates that HVBP performance metrics do not exist in isolation. Rather, they possess strong associations to the community factors in which the institution resides. Aggregating a broad set of factors from disparate data sources, this work moves through the informatics pipeline. Identifying performance scoring profiles though clustering and employing robust linear models to uncover novel relationships and advance the discussion around the need for value-based care quality metrics.</p>

								<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong>
									Extremely preterm infants represent one of the highest risk categories for impairments in social competence. Few studies have explored the impact of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment on social development. However, none have specifically analyzed the effects of the care structure the infant receives during hospitalization on later social competence indicators.<br>

								<strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong>
									To identify associations between the care structures received by extremely preterm infants in the NICU and scores on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) post-discharge.<br>

								<strong>PARTICIPANTS:</strong>
									50 extremely preterm infants (mean gestational age: 25 weeks during hospitalization; mean chronological age during follow-up assessment: 2 years, 4 months).<br>

								<strong>METHODS:</strong>
									A secondary analysis of BITSEA data was performed exploring its relation to care structure data we extracted from electronic medical records (i.e., how much time infants were engaged in human interaction during their first thirty days of hospitalization and what types of interaction they were exposed to).<br>

								<strong>RESULTS:</strong>
									Extremely preterm infants spend a considerable amount of time alone during hospitalization (80%) with nursing care comprising the majority of human interaction. Infants who experienced greater human interaction scored significantly higher on the Social Competence (p = 0.01) and lower on the Dysregulation (p = 0.03) BITSEA subscales.<br>

								<strong>CONCLUSION:</strong>
								Human interaction and isolation in the NICU is associated with social competence and dysregulation outcomes in extremely preterm infants. Further research is needed to understand how various NICU care structures including centralized nursing teams, parental skin-to-skin care, and early therapy may synergistically play a positive role in developing social competence.<br>

								<strong>AIMS:</strong>
									This pilot study explored how maternal stress experienced in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is affected by the individual nursing structure and the network that provides care to extremely preterm infants.<br>

								<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong>
									Mothers experience high stress when their extremely preterm infants are hospitalized in the NICU. This often translates into maladaptive parenting behaviours that negatively affect the long-term cognitive, social, and emotional development of the infant. Efforts to identify modifiable sources of maternal stress in the NICU could lead to improvement in maternal engagement and, ultimately, long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.<br>

								<strong>METHOD:</strong>
									Time- and date-stamped nursing shift data were extracted from the medical record and transformed into five structural nursing metrics with resultant nurse data networks. These were then analysed for associations with maternal stress outcomes on the Parental Stressor Scale (PSS: NICU).<br>

								<strong>RESULTS:</strong>
									Infants experienced highly variable nursing care and networks of nurses throughout their hospitalization. This variability is associated with the PSS: NICU (a) Sights and Sounds and (b) Altered Parental Role subscales.<br>

								<strong>CONCLUSION:</strong>
									Nursing structure and the resultant caregiving network have an impact on maternal stress.<br>

								<strong>IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT:</strong>
									Changing the pattern of nurse staffing may be a modifiable intervention target for reducing maternal stress in the NICU.<br>

                                                        <p>Coupled with the rise of data science and machine learning, the increasing availability of digitized health and wellness data has provided an exciting opportunity for complex analyses of problems throughout the healthcare domain. Whereas many early works focused on a particular aspect of patient care, often drawing on data from a specific clinical or administrative source, it has become clear such a single-source approach is insufficient to capture the complexity of the human condition. Instead, adequately modeling health and wellness problems requires the ability to draw upon data spanning multiple facets of an individual’s biology, their care, and the social aspects of their life. Although such an awareness has greatly expanded the breadth of health and wellness data collected, the diverse array of data sources and intended uses often leave researchers and practitioners with a scattered and fragmented view of any particular patient. As a result, there exists a clear need to catalogue and organize the range of healthcare data available for analysis. This work represents an effort at developing such an organization, presenting a patient-centric framework deemed the Healthcare Data Spectrum (HDS). Comprised of six layers, the HDS begins with the innermost micro-level omics and macro-level demographic data that directly characterize a patient, and extends at its outermost to aggregate population-level data derived from attributes of care for each individual patient. For each level of the HDS, this manuscript will examine the specific types of constituent data, provide examples of how the data aid in a broad set of research problems, and identify the primary terminology and standards used to describe the data.</p>

                                                        <p>While healthcare has traditionally existed within the confines of formal clinical environments, the emergence of population health initiatives has given rise to a new and diverse set of community interventions. As the number of interventions continues to grow, the ability to quickly and accurately identify those most relevant to an individual’s specific need has become essential in the care process. However, due to the diverse nature of the interventions, the determination need often requires non-clinical social and behavioral information that must be collected from the individuals themselves. Although survey tools have demonstrated success in the collection of this data, time restrictions and diminishing respondent interest have presented barriers to obtaining up-to-date information on a regular basis. In response, researchers have turned to analytical approaches to optimize surveys and quantify the importance of each question. To date, the majority of these works have approached the task from a univariate standpoint, identifying the next most important question to ask. However, such an approach fails to address the interconnected nature of the health conditions inherently captured by the broader set of survey questions. Utilizing data mining and machine learning methodology, this work demonstrates the value of capturing these relations. We present a novel framework that identifies a variable-length subset of survey questions most relevant in determining the need for a particular health intervention for a given individual. We evaluate the framework using a large national longitudinal dataset centered on aging, demonstrating the ability to identify the questions with the highest impact across a variety of interventions.</p>

                                                        <p>The rates of childhood obesity are at an all-time high, both domestically and around the globe. In an effort to stem current trends, researchers have looked to understand the components of effective and sustainable interventions. Although obesity interventions have often focused on a single lifestyle factors such as activity or nutrition, recent focus has shifted to a broader set of interventions that address multiple aspects of a child’s life concurrently. Yet, despite promising outcomes, an understanding of what drives the success or failure of an intervention for a speciﬁc child is not yet well understood. To this end we have designed FitSpace, a web-based health and wellness platform designed to help understand how goal setting, activity, and nutrition patterns are tied to a child’s social-demographic proﬁle and their overall success in achieving sustainable healthy behavior. The work presented here represents the ﬁrst step in our research, detailing a usability pilot study of the platform run in partnership with a local high school.</p>

                                                        <p>From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operated under a paper-based paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare data presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted for throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes of the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations during model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose on the efficiency of machine learning techniques.</p>

                                                        <p>Predicting the onset of heart disease is of obvious importance as doctors try to improve the general health of their patients. If it were possible to identify high-risk patients before their heart failure diagnosis, doctors could use that information to implement preventative measures to keep a heart failure diagnosis from becoming a reality. Integration of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) into clinical practice has enabled the use of computational techniques for personalized healthcare at scale. The larger goal of such modeling is to pivot from reactive medicine to preventative care and early detection of adverse conditions. In this paper, we present a trajectory-based disease progression model to detect chronic heart failure. We validate our work on a database of Medicare records of 1.1 million elderly US patients. Our supervised approach allows us to assign likelihood of chronic heart failure for an unseen patient’s disease history and identify key disease progression trajectories that intensify or diminish said likelihood. This information will be a tremendous help as patients and doctors try to understand what are the most dangerous diagnoses for those who are susceptible to heart failure. Using our model, we demonstrate some of the most common disease trajectories that eventually result in the development of heart failure.</p>

                                                        <p>The increasing availability of electronic health care records has provided remarkable progress in the field of population health. In particular the identification of disease risk factors has flourished under the surge of available data. Researchers can now access patient data across a broad range of demographics and geographic locations. Utilizing this Big healthcare data researchers have been able to empirically identify specific high-risk conditions found within differing populations. However to date the majority of studies approached the issue from the top down, focusing on the prevalence of specific diseases within a population. Through our work we demonstrate the power of addressing this issue bottom-up by identifying specifically which diseases are higher-risk for a specific population. In this work we demonstrate that network-based analysis can present a foundation to identify pairs of diagnoses that differentiate across population segments. We provide a case study highlighting differences between high and low income individuals in the United States. This work is particularly valuable when addressing population health management within resource-constrained environments such as community health programs where it can be used to provide insight and resource planning into targeted care for the population served.</p>

                                                        <p>Over the past decade, the application of data science techniques to clinical data has allowed practitioners and researchers to develop a sundry of analytical models. These models have traditionally relied on structured data drawn from Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Yet, a large portion of EMR data remains unstructured, primarily held within clinical notes. While recent work has produced techniques for extracting structured features from unstructured text, this work generally operates under the untested assumption that all clinical text can be processed in a similar manner. This paper provides what we believe to be the ﬁrst comprehensive evaluation of the differences between four major sources of clinical text, providing an evaluation of the structural, linguistic, and topical differences among notes of each category. Our conclusions support the premise that tools designed to extract structured data from clinical text must account for the categories of text they process.</p>

                                                        <p>On April 2nd, 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a historic policy in its effort to increase the transparency in the American healthcare system. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) would publicly release a dataset containing information about the types of Medicare services, requested charges, and payments issued by providers across the country. In its release, HHS stated that the data would shed light on “Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse.” While this is most certainly true, we believe that it can provide so much more. Beyond the purely financial aspects of procedure charges and payments, the procedures themselves may provide us with additional information, not only about the Medicare population, but also about the physicians themselves. The procedures a physician performs are for the most part not novel, but rather recommended, observed, and studied. However, whether a physician decides on advocating a procedure is somewhat discretionary. Some patients require a clear course of action, while others may benefit from a variety of options. This article poses the following question: How does a physician's past experience in medical school shape his or her practicing decisions? This article aims to open the analysis into how data, such as the CMS Medicare release, can help further our understanding of knowledge transfer and how experiences during education can shape a physician's decision's over the course of his or her career. This work begins with an evaluation into similarities between medical school charges, procedures, and payments. It then details how schools' procedure choices may link them in other, more interesting ways. Finally, the article includes a geographic analysis of how medical school procedure payments and charges are distributed nationally, highlighting potential deviations.</p>

                                                        <p>Today, advances in medical informatics brought on by the increasing availability of electronic medical records (EMR) have allowed for the proliferation of data-centric tools, especially in the context of personalized healthcare. While these tools have the potential to greatly improve the quality of patient care, the effective utilization of their techniques within clinical practice may encounter two significant challenges. First, the increasing amount of electronic data generated by clinical processes can impose scalability challenges for current computational tools, requiring parallel or distributed implementations of such tools to scale. Secondly, as technology becomes increasingly intertwined in clinical workflows these tools must not only operate efficiently, but also in an interpretable manner. Failure to identity areas of uncertainty or provide appropriate context creates a potentially complex situation for both physicians and patients. This paper will present a case study investigating the issues associated with first scaling a disease prediction algorithm to accommodate dataset sizes expected in large medical practices. It will then provide an analysis on the diagnoses predictions, attempting to provide contextual information to convey the certainty of the results to a physician. Finally it will investigate latent demographic features of the patient’s themselves, which may have an impact on the accuracy of the diagnosis predictions.</p>

                                                        <p>In today’s healthcare environment, nurses play an integral role in determining patient outcomes. This role becomes especially clear in intensive care units such as the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). In the NICU, critically ill infants rely almost completely on the care of these nurses for survival. Given the importance of their role, and the volatile conditions of the infants, it is imperative that nurses be able to focus on the infants in their charge. In order to provide this level of care there must be an appropriate infant to nurse ratio each day. However traditional stafﬁng models often utilize a number of factors, including historical census counts, which when incorrect leave a NICU at risk of operating barely reaching, or even below the recommended stafﬁng level. This work will present the novel ADMIT (Admission Duration Model for Infant Treatment) model, which yields personalized length of stay estimates for an infant, utilizing data available from time of admission to the NICU.</p>

                                                        <p>Today the healthcare industry is undergoing one of the most important and challenging transitions to date, the move from paper to electronic healthcare records. While the healthcare industry has generally been an incrementally advancing field, this change has the potential to be revolutionarily. Using the data collected from these electronic records exciting tools such as disease recommendation systems have been created to deliver personalized models of an individual’s health profile. However despite their early success, tools such as these will soon encounter a significant problem. The amount of healthcare encounter data collected is increasing drastically, and the computational time for these applications will soon reach a point at which these systems can no longer function in a practical timeframe for clinical use. This paper will begin by analyzing the performance limitations of the personalized disease prediction engine CARE (Collaborative Assessment and Recommendation Engine). Next it will detail the creation and performance of a new single patient implementation of the algorithm. Finally this work will demonstrate a novel parallel implementation of the CARE algorithm, and demonstrate the performance benefits on big patient data.</p>

                                                        <p>Successful aging or aging well is a very complex process. This process is usually defined as having the following components: managing chronic conditions, maintaining physical and mental health, social engagement. There exist many solutions in isolation for these individual components that assist in aging well. However, while these components in isolation can work, we believe that the real strength of these components is in their synergism-in their combined power to help seniors in aging well. We are developing a unified framework "eSeniorCare", which addresses all of these components together. It is a mobile platform that has the following features: medication scheduling, daily activity tracker. As a part of this framework, sessions are conducted to provide motivational lectures in aging. In this paper, we present the first phase of the framework</p>
